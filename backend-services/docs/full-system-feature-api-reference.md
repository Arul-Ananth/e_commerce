Project: `e_commerce` (`backend-services` + `frontend`)

## 1. System Overview

This system is a role-based e-commerce app with:
- JWT auth (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_MANAGER`, optional `ROLE_EMPLOYEE`)
- Product catalog with category filtering and discounts
- Cart with additive discount calculation
- Checkout with pluggable payment gateway (`stripe` or `razorpay`)
- Admin/manager user and product management
- Secure image upload for product media

## 2. Backend Features by Module

### Checkout and Payments
